**Word World**

Word World is a multi-page app for creative authors and artists. Creatives can upload their original light novels or comics for the entire community to read and enjoy. Successful creatives can even earn from the site. This app is built entirely in Vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML. There is also a need togo further and implement a dedicated backend server for the site since as it is now it is purely for demonstration purposes.
